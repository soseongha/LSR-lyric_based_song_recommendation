Dancing through our house
with the ghost of you
And I chase it down
with a shot of truth
Dancing through our house
with the ghost of you
Cleaning up today
found that old Zeppelin shirt
You wore when you ran away
and no one could feel your hurt
We're too young too dumb
to know things like love
But I know better now
better now
So I drown it out

I wish I had eyes in the back of my head
Then I could see the places I've been
But then I would know that you're talkin' shit
I don't want to know what my friends think


Wish I were my dog out on the lawn
I'd be so glad when I hear you come home
But if I were my dog, I wouldn't live long
I'm sure gonna miss her when she's gone


I wish I could act in a show on TV
'Cause then I could practice not bein' me
I'll practice my cry, put it into my reel
But you won't believe me when I cry for real


I wish that my brain would triple in size
I'd nail every joke, I'd win every fight
But I'd get too deep with that kind of mind
I don't wanna know the point of life

In some other life I would be rich
I'd travel in style, I'd cover the bill
But couldn't complain 'bout anything small
Nobody'd feel bad for me at all


If I was cocaine or a bottle of Jack
I'd get invited to every frat
But when you get old and your good days have passed
You'll only want me when you're sad


Wish I was a song, your favorite one
You'd follow the dance to me at your prom
I would be there when your baby is born
For two or three minutes, then I'm gone


I wish I was big, as big as my house
I'd sleep on the trees, I'd skip every crowd
But I wouldn't fit on my therapist's couch
God, I could really use him now


I wish I was God, I'd never trip up
And if I did, well, so fuckin' what?
I could be cruel and break all your stuff
Yeah, I'd be loved no matter what

But if I was God, it'd get kinda weird
'Cause you would only say what I wanna hear
And then you would die, you'd love me to death
I'd never know who the hell I am


I wish I was me, whoever that is
I could just be and not give a shit
Hey, I'll be whatever makes you a fan
'Cause I don't know who the hell I am

I don’t know it's alright
I've been dealin’ with some things
like every human being
And really didn't sleep
much last night
I'm sorry that's fine
I just think
I need a little me time
I just think
I need a little free time
Little break from the shows
and the bus rides yeah
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me
I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist
then I found out
Somethin' funny’s goin’
on up in my house
Yeah I started thinkin'
maybe I should move out
You know pack my cart
take a new route
Clean up my yard get the noose out
Hang up my heart let it air out
I’ve been searchin'
What does that mean
Nate I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes
leavin’ my burdens
Well I brought a few with me
I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view
like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues right
I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight
life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be
a long journey but hey
It's worth it though
Cold world out there kids
grab your coats
It's been a minute I know
now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote
to crack the code
Pretty vivid I admit it
I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me
but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me
I'ma have to crack
your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map
to hope you seen it
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that
you should play it
I get scared when
I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd
and see so many faces yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts
can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup
and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm saying and
Where'd the beat go
Oh ain't that somethin'
Drums came in
you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head
can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame
had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up
like I don't want it
Wipe my face clean off my vomit
OCD tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it
now y'all done it
I can be critical never typical
Intricate with every syllable
I'm a criminal
Intimate but never political
pretty visual
Even if you hate it I'll make it
feel like you're in it though
You call me what you wanna
but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought
I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been
thinkin' is cinematic
it's beautiful
Man I don't know
if I'm makin' movies or music videos
Videos videos
Yeah the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though
when your health declines
See we've all got somethin'
that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate you know
hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater
but it always survives
Then it comes up out of nowhere
like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you
to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that
Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin'
is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it
can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool right
Yeah but it's not always safe
Just hang with me
this'll only take a moment okay
Just think about it for a second
if you look at your face
Every day when you get up
and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great
not because you're not
but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up
and murder your faith
Woo
I've been developin'
take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with
I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant
That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement
then bag it up and give me
the evidence
Pretty evident
dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman
depending on
if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant
but not afraid to
tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette
I keep it to myself
when I celebrate ah
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons
and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on
yeah strap 'em in
Look at me everybody
I'm smilin' big
On a road right now
that I can't predict
Tell me Tone that down
but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound

What's my definition of success?
Listening to what your hеart says
Standing up for what you know is
Right, while everybody else is
Tucking their tail
between their legs (Okay)
What's my definition
of success? (Success)
Creating something no one else can
Bein' brave enough to dream big
Grindin' when you're told to just quit
Givin' more when you got nothin' left
It's a person that'll take a chance on
Somethin' they were told
could never happen
It's a person
that can see the bright side
Through the dark times
when there ain't one
It's when someone
who ain't never had nothin'
Ain't afraid to walk away
from more profit
'Cause they'd rather do somethin'
that they really love
And take the pay cut
It's a person that would never waiver
Or change who they are
Just to try to and gain some credibility
So they could feel accepted
by a stranger
It's a person that can take
the failures in their life
And turn them into motivation
It's believing in yourself
when no one else does
It's amazing
What a little bit of faith can do
if you don't even believe in you
Why would you think or expect
anybody else that's around you to?
I done did things that I regret
I done said things I can't take back
Was a lost soul at a cross road
who had no hope, but I changed that
I spent years of my life
holdin' on to things I never
should've kept, full of hatred
Years of my life carryin'
a lot of baggage that I should've
walked away from
Years of my life wishin'
I was someone different,
lookin' for some validation
Years of my life tryna fill the void,
pretending I was in-
They get it
Growing pain's a necessary evil
Difficult to go through,
yes, but beneficial
Some would say having a mental
breakdown is a negative thing
Which on one hand I agree with
On the other hand,
it was the push I needed
To get help and start
the healing process, see
If I'd have never hit rock bottom
Would I be the person that I am today?
I don't believe so
I'm a prime example of
what happens when you
Choose to not accept defeat
and face your demons
Took me thirty years to
realize that if you
Wanna get the opportunity
to be the greatest version of yourself
Sometimes you got to be
someone you're not
To hear the voice of reason
Having kids will make you really
take a step back and look in the mirror
At least for me, that's what it did, I
Wake up every day and pick my son up
Hold him in my arms and let him know
he's loved (Loved)
Standing by the window,
questioning if dad is ever
going to show up (Up)
Isn't something he's goin' to
have to worry 'bout
Don't get it twisted, that wasn't a shot
Mama, I forgive you
I just don't want him to grow up
thinkin' that he'll never be enough
Thirty years of running,
thirty years of searching
Thirty years of hurting,
thirty years of pain
Thirty years of fearful,
thirty years of anger
Thirty years of empty,
thirty years of shame
Thirty years of broken,
thirty years of anguish

Watching my self-esteem go up
in flames, acting like I don't
Care what anyone else thinks
When I know truthfully that that's
the furthest thing from how I
Feel, but I'm too proud to
open up and ask you
To pick me up and pull me out
this hole I'm trapped in
The truth is I need help,
but I just can't imagine
Who I'd be if I was happy
Yeah, been this way so long
It feels like something's off
when I'm not depressed
I got some issues that I won't address
I got some baggage I ain't open yet
I got some demons I should put to rest
I got some traumas that I can't forget
I got some phone calls
I've been avoiding
Some family members
I don't really connect with
Some things I said,
I wish I woulda not let slip
Some hurtful words that
never shoulda left my lips
Some bridges burned,
I'm not ready to rebuild yet
Some insecurities
I haven't dealt with, yes
I'll be the first to admit
that I'm a lonely soul
And the last to admit
I need a hand to hold
Losing hope,
heading down a dangerous road
Strange, I know,
but I feel most at home when I'm?
Living in my agony
Watching my self-esteem go up
in flames, acting like I don't
Care what anyone else thinks
When I know truthfully that
that's the furthest thing from how I
Feel, but I'm too proud to
open up and ask you
To pick me up and pull me out
this hole I'm trapped in
The truth is I need help,
but I just can't imagine
Who I'd be if I was happy
Don't know what's around the bend
Don't know what my future is
But I can't keep on living in?
Living in my agony
Watching my self-esteem go up
in flames, acting like I don't
Care what anyone else thinks

MOTTO,NF,MOTTO,2023.03.09,랩/힙합,"2,385","I could write a record
full of radio songs
Do a bunch of features
that my label would love
Do a bunch of features
that I don't even like
Just to build up the hype, yeah
I could sell my house
and move out to LA
Get inside of rooms
with the biggest of names
Hire fifty people
just to give me advice
On the way I should write (Oh, God)
Yeah, sounds like a nightmare
if you ask me
Yeah, went from my bedroom
to the big leagues
You know how many times
that I was told things
Wouldn't work? But worked out,
havin' cold feet
Didn't keep mе from success,
but delayed it somе
I used to be the guy
who'd kill to get a number one
I had to hear ""That song's a hit""
before I thought it was
But nowadays
I don't really give a- (What?)
Oh, God (Yeah)
Might catch me at the award show
Eatin' popcorn in the back row
Catchin' Zs with my hat low
No nominations, but it's cool though
Oh, God
You might see me in the same clothes
I had on last week,
am I ashamed? No (Yeah)
You heard the sayin', ""If it ain't broke
Don't fix it,"" that's my motto
Yeah, I miss buyin' CDs at the store
And thumbin' through the cases
tryin' to make a choice (Yeah)
That don't make no sense to you?
Well, of course
See, one man's inconvenience
is another's joy
Wow, wow, how are you unemployed
Tellin' me to get a life?
You should look at yours (Yup)
Congratulations,
you can raise your voice
Hope you break both of your legs
fallin' off your horse
(Oh, snap) This is the industry
Where it ain't how big you are,
it's how big you seem
Where people sacrifice
the art tryin' to chase a dream
Then they wonder
why they music's lackin' creativity
(Oh, yeah) Would've
gave anything
To be respected
by the artist I was listening
To, but not no more,
them days are history
Skip the red carpet,
you lookin' for me?
Oh, God (Yeah)
You might catch me
at the award show
Eatin' popcorn in the back row
Catchin' Zs with my hat low
No nominations, but it's cool though
Oh, God
You might see me
in the same clothes
I had on last week,
am I ashamed? No (Yeah)
You heard the sayin', ""If it ain't broke
Don't fix it,"" that's my motto
Got my feet propped up
Leave my shirts untucked
I'm the boss, so what?
I do what I want (Oh, God)
You got the trophy, that's great
I'm happy for you, no hate
Still got a smile on my face
Chillin' in the back like, ""Hey""
Oh, God (Yeah)
You might catch me

Eatin' popcorn in the back row
Catchin' Zs with my hat low
No nominations,

The Search (Edit),NF,The Search (Edit),2019.06.07,랩/힙합,613,"""Hey, Nate, how's life?""
I don't know, it's alright
I've been dealin' with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night (last night)
""I'm sorry"", that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides (bus rides), yeah
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny's goin' on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my car, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out (air out)
I've been searchin'
""What does that mean, Nate?""
I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin' my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view like, this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey (but hey)
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
Been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid, I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it? (You seen it?)
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm saying, and
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean up my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (videos, videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great, not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith (woo!)
I am developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident, dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah (ah)
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me ""Tone that down, "" but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist
The search begins, I'm back, so enjoy the trip, huh"

Stairway To Love,George Benson,Irreplaceable,2003.01.01,R&B/Soul,"21,800","You were the owner of a
broken heart
You didn't know that I was
falling in love from a far
Every morning
wiping tears from your eyes
You never dreamed
someone was watching
You heard every cry
What are the odds of
a fool finding in love
It's a one in a million
a shot in the dark
Just when I thought
there's no need hold in on
You wrapped me in your arms
And took me
on a stairway to love
And that's where
you'll find true emotion dear
Deeper than the deepest ocean
High up where
jealous fools can't break us
We're on a stairway to love
Stairway to love

A little candle light
a fire for two
A glass of chardonnay
bring out the lover in you
So dancing through the night
Makes a picture so right
Two silhouettes framed as
one in the moonlight
What are the odds of
a fool finding in love
It's a one in a million
a shot in the dark
Just when I thought
there's no need holdin on
You wrapped me in your arms
And took me
on a stairway to love
And that's where
you'll find true emotion dear
Deeper than the deepest ocean
High up where jealous
fools can't break us
We're on a stairway to love
Stairway to love
Are you ready
We can fly away
right now to Tahiti
Pack your bags
Whatever you want
you can have
Here on the stairway to love
It's where
you'll find true emotion dear
Deeper than the deepest ocean
High up where jealous
fools can't break us
We're on a stairway to love
Stairway to love
Deeper than the deepest
Up where jealous fools
can't break us
We're on a stairway
Stairway to love

We're on a stairway"
Give Me The Night,George Benson,Give Me The Night,1980.08,재즈,"1,811","Whenever dark has fallen
you know the spirit of the party
starts to come alive.
Until the day is dawning
you can throw out all your blues
and hit the city lights.
'Cause there's music in the air
and lots of loving everywhere
so gimme the night. Gimme the night.You need the evening action,
a place to dine, a glass of wine,
a little late romance.
It's a chain reaction.
You'll see the people of the world
coming out to dance.
'Cause there's music in the air
and lots of loving everywhere
so gimme the night. Gimme the night.So come on out tonight
and we'll lead the others
on a ride through paradise.
And if you feel all right
then we can be lovers 'cause I see that
starlight look in your eyes.
Don't you know we can fly?
Just gimme the night. Gimme the night.And if we stay together,
we'll feel the rhythm of the evening
taking us up high.
Never mind the weather.
We'll be dancing in the street
until the morning light.
'Cause there's music in the air
and lots of loving everywhere.
So gimme the night. Gimme the night..."
The Greatest Love Of All,George Benson,The Greatest Hits Of All,2003.07.08,재즈,155,"I believe the children are our future
Teach them well And let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty They possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone to fulfill my needs
A lonely place to be
and So I learned to depend on me
I decided long ago
and Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At last I live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
was happening to me
I've found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
is Easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
Is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well And let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty They possess inside
and Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago
and Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At last I live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
was happening to me
I've found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
is Easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
Is the greatest love of all

And if by chance that special place
That You've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love"

Makin' mistakes, then you beg me to stay
Got me wiggin' on you like I'm Arrogant Tae

All I really know is M bags like I drove through

Sayin' that I'm too guarded with my feelings,
who the fuck even asked you?
Seven bodyguards just in case
somebody really wanna try and crash through
Don't know why I listen to you
when I hear you talkin' to me, it's some half-truths

The Winner Takes It All,ABBA,ABBA The Definitive Collection,2001.11.01,POP,"6,071","I don't wanna talk
About the things we've gone
through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain
But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say
Rules must be obeyed
The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all"

이 저녁시간을 나 혼자 보내야 한다는 사실이
Autumn winds Blowing outside the window
as I look around the room
창밖을 보니 가을바람은 불고
And it makes me so depressed to see the groom

There's not a soul out there
밖에는 아무도 없어요
No one to hear my prayer
내 소망을 들어줄 사람은 없어요

이밤이 지나고 나면 누군가를 데려다 주세요
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
그림자를 쫓아줄 사람은 필요없구요
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
이밤이 지나고 나면 누군가를 데려다 주세요
Take me through the darkness
to the break of the day
이 어두움이 지나갈때까지만
있어주면 돼요

with that fortune to win
영화배우들은 행운의 승리에 황홀하겠지만
It's so different from the world I'm living in
내가 살고 있는 세상과는 다르잖아요
Tired of T.V. I open the window
and I gaze into the night
TV 보는것도 실증이 나고
창문을 열고 밤의 적막을 바라봐요

One more look and I forget everything, o-o-o-

Mamma mia, does it show again?

Why, why did I ever let you go?

Mamma mia, now I really know, My my, I could
never let you go.

I've been angry and sad about the things that
you do

I can't count all the times that I've told
you we're through

And when you go, when you slam the door

I think you know that you won't be away too
long

You know that I'm not that strong.

If I tell a jok
you've probably
heard it before
But I have a talent
a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens
when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want
is to sing it out loud
So I say
Thank you for the music
the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy
they're bringing
Who can live without it
I ask in all honesty
What would life be
Without a song or
a dance what are we
So I say
thank you for the music
For giving it to me
Mother says I was a dancer
before I could walk
She says I began to sing
long before I could talk
And I've often wondered
how did it all start
Who found out that
nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can
Well whoever it was I'm a fan
So I say
Thank you for the music
the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy
they're bringing
Who can live without it
I ask in all honesty
What would life be
Without a song

For giving it to me

I am the girl
with golden hair
I wanna sing it

what a chance

Lay All Your Love On Me,ABBA,ABBA The Definitive Collection,2001.11.01,POP,"1,395","I wasn't jealous
before we met
Now every woman I see
is a potential threat
And I'm possessive it
isn't nice
You've heard me saying that
smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned
has overturned
I beg of you
Don't go wasting
your emotion
Lay all your love on me
It was I shooting
a sitting duck
A little small talk a smile
and baby I was stuck
I still don't know
what you've done with me
A grown up woman should
never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied I skip my pride
I beg you dear
Don't go wasting
your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing
your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little
love affairs
They didn't last very
long and they've been
pretty scarce
I used to think that
was sensible
It makes the truth
even more incomprehensible
Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned
has overturned
What can I do
Don't go wasting
your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing

Lay all your love on me

Slipping Through My Fingers,ABBA,The Albums,2008.11.07,POP,547,"Schoolbag in hand
she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye
with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that
well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing
her forever
And without really entering
her world
I'm glad whenever I can
share her laughter
That funny little girl
Slipping through my fingers
all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers
all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think
I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers
all the time
Sleep in our eyes
her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake
I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone
there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to the
wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go
Slipping through my fingers
all the time
Well some of that we did
but most we didn't
And why I just don't know
Slipping through my fingers
all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers
all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think
I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers
all the time
Sometimes I wish that I could
freeze the picture
And save it
from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers
Slipping through my fingers
all the time
Schoolbag in hand
she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye
with an absent-minded smile"

That I never knew never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as
I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out
your name your name
When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
nothing is better
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I
touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out
your name your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell something died
'Cause I knew that that was
the last time the last time
Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be
waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from
looking for you
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I
touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out
your name your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell something died
'Cause I knew that that was
the last time the last time
Oh oh no
Let it burn
Oh oh oh
Let it burn
Let it burn"
Make You Feel My Love,Adele,19 (Explicit Ver.),2008.11.17,POP,"52,833","When the rain
Is blowing in your face
And the whole world
Is on your case
I could offer you
A warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows
And the stars appear
And there is no one
there To dry your tears
I could hold you
For a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you
Haven't made Your mind up yet
But I would
never Do you wrong
I've known it
From the moment
That we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong
I'd go hungry
I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling
Down the avenue
No there's nothing
That I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging
On the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
Though winds of change Are
throwing wild and free
You ain't
seen nothing Like me yet
I could make you happy
Make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends
Of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love"
Skyfall (Full Length),Adele,Skyfall (Full Length),2012.10.04,POP,"43,901","This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and
dreamed this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
When worlds collide,
and days are dark
You may have my number,
you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
Where you go I go,
What you see I see
I know I'll never be me,
without the security
Are your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall"

starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and
it's bringing me out the dark
Finally
I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out

Don't underestimate
the things that I will do
There's a fire
starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and
it's bringing me out the dark

remind me of us
They keep me thinking that
we almost had it all
The scars of your love
they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
rolling in the deep
You had my heart
inside of your hands
And you played it to the beat
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and
I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me
in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine
sure won't be shared
The scars of your love
remind me of us
They keep me thinking
that we almost had it all
The scars of your love
they leave me breathless

And you played it to the beat
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart
inside of your hands
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through
every open door
Count your blessings to find
what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind
and reap just what you've sown
We could have had it all
We could have had it all
It all it all it all
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart

The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002
We were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing love is forever and ever
Well I guess that was true
Dancing on the hood
in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang
where we sang
Songs with all
our childhood friends
And it went like this say
Oops I got 99 problems
singing bye bye bye
Hold up if you wanna go
and take a ride with me
Better hit me baby one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young
Singing at the top of both our lungs
Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to 2002
Dancing on the hood
in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang
where we sang
Songs with all

But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you're my destiny

And there are doors
that we can't walk through

Because we're able to be

see that it was hopeless after all

Stop loving you so much
Haven't seen that me for so long
Forgot I shouldn't care
I sang ""Dum di di""

Do not need your
advice or cheap blessing
Here's my crown you couldn't lift
You want me to act a certain way
I'm no one's toy no more, it hurts them
To know they can't control me each day
Enjoy the pain
I don't need your expectations
Made the bricks to pave my way
Fuck that Grammy nomination
Happiness cannot be bought
One summer day,
we just might meet up again
Hey, look at you sitting here
all on your own
Lost in your expectations
I can't help you with that
I can't ever hate you
But had to let you go
Changing myself for your ego
and selfish pride stops there
I sang ""Karate""

Won't let them stray too far away

Let`s talk this over
It`s not like we`re dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something You said?

Don`t leave me hanging
In a city so dead Held up so high
On such a breakable thread

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

You were everything,
everything that I wanted
We were meant to be,
supposed to be, but we lost it

All of the memories, so close to me,
just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

oh oh, oh oh,
so much for my happy ending
Oh oh, oh oh

You`ve got your dumb friends
I know what they say (they say)
They tell you I`m difficult
But so are they(so are they)

But they don`t know me
Do they even know you?
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do
(all the shit that you do)

You were all the things
I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

You were everything,
everything that I wanted
We were meant to be,
supposed to be, but we lost it

All of the memories,
so close to me, just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

It`s nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you cared
And making me feel like I was the only one

It`s nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done

reminds me of you

Fixer Upper,"Christophe Beck, Cast - Frozen",겨울왕국 OST (Deluxe Edition),2013.01.01,"POP, 애니메이션/웹툰, 키즈, 만화",632,"What's the issue dear
Why are you holding back from
such a man
Is it the clumpy way he walks
Or the grumpy way he talks
Or the pear shaped square shaped
Weirdness of his feet
And though we know he washes
Well he always ends up sort of
smelly
But you'll never meet a fellow
who's as
Sensitive and sweet
So he's a bit of a fixer upper
So he's got a few flaws
Like his peculiar brain dear
His thing with the reindeer
That's a little outside of
nature's laws
So he's a bit of a fixer upper
but this we're certain of
You can fix this fixer upper
Up with a little bit of love
Can we please just
Stop talking about this
We've got a real actual problem
here
I'll say So tell me dear
Is it the way that he runs scared
Or that he's socially impaired
Or that he only likes to tinkle
in the woods what
Are you holding back your
Fondness due to his unmanly
blondness
Or the way he covers
Up that he's the honest goods
He’s just a bit of a fixer upper
He's got a couple of bugs
His isolation is confirmation
Of his desperation for human hugs
So he's a bit of a fixer upper
But we know what to do
The way to fix up this fixer upper
Is to fix him up with you
ENOUGH She is engaged
to someone else okay
So she's a bit of a fixer upper
That's a minor thing
Her quote 'engagement' is a flex
arrangement
And by the way I don't see no
ring
So she's a bit of a fixer upper
Her brain's a bit betwixt
Get the fiance out of the way and
The whole thing will be fixed
We're not sayin'
you can change him
'Cause people don't really
change
We're only saying that love's
a force
That's powerful and strange
People make bad choices
if they're mad
Or scared or stressed
Throw a little love their way
Throw a little love their way
you'll bring out their best
True love brings out their best
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper
That's what it's all about
Father
Sister
Brother
We need each other to raise
Us up and round us out
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper
But when push comes to shove
The only fixer upper fixer
That can fix up a fixer upper is
True true
True true true
Love True love
Love love love love love
Love True love
True

to the song here in my heart
내맘속 노래를 들어봐

A melody I started but cant complete

내가 시작했지만 끝내질 못하겠어
Listen, to the sound from deep within

깊은곳에서 나오는 소리를 들어봐
It's only beginning to find release

해방되는 유일한 방법이야

Oh the time has come
for my dreams to be heard

내꿈이 이뤄질 때가 왔네
They will not be pushed aside and turned

내꿈은 무시될수 없어
Into your own all 'cause you wont listen

니가 듣지 않는대도 내꿈은 이뤄진다

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads

들어봐, 난 교차로에 서있지
I'm not at home in my own home

난 집이 아닌, 나만의 공간에 있지
And I've tried and tried
to say whats on my mind

내맘속 말들을 말하려고 노력하고 있어
You should have known

넌 알아야만해

Now I don't believe in you

그리고 난 널 믿지 않아
You dont know what I'm feeling

어떤기분인지 모를거야
I'm more than what you made of me

난 당신이 만든것보다 더 훌륭한 사람이야
I found the voice you gave to me

당신이 준 목소리를 찾아냈지
But now I've gotta find my own

근데 이젠 나만의 것을 찾아야해
You should have listened

당신은 들어봐야해

There is someone here inside

이안에 누군가 있어
Someone I thought had died so long ago

오래전에 죽었다고 생각했던 누군가 있어




Oh Im screaming out
for my dream to be heard

They will not be pushed aside or turned

Into your own all 'cause you won't listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
to say whats on my mind
You should have know

Oh now I don't believe in you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I found the voice you gave to me
But now i've gotta find my own





I don't know where I belong

난 어디에 속해야 하는걸까
But I'll be moving on

알수없지만 어쨌든 움직여야해
If you don't,

니가 안한다면
If you won't

니가 안할거라면

Listen, to the song here in my heart

내맘속 노래를 들어봐
A melody I started
But I will complete

내가 시작했지만 끝맺을수가 없는 노래

Now I don't beleive in you

이젠 당신을 믿지않지
You dont know what I'm feeling

이게 어떤 기분인지 모르지
I'm more than what you made of me

당신이 날 만든것보다 난 놀라운 존재지
I found the voice you think you gave to me

당신이 준 목소리를 찾아냈지
But now I've gotta find my own

이젠 나만의 목소리를 찾을 차례지
my own...

나만의 목소리를.."

Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that
I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
to come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
It's a little too late
for you to come back
Say its just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
How it feels to love a girl someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted

A little bit bigger now

All it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little
When I hear your name
It all just sounds like oooooh
Mmm too young
too dumb to realize
That i
Should've bought you flowers
And held you hands
Should've gave you
all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you
wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing
But shes dancing
with another man
My pride my ego my
needs and my selfish ways
Cause the good strong
woman like you
to walk out my life
Now I never
never get to clean up the mess
I made
Ooh and it hunts me every time
I close my eyes

Although it hurts
Ill be the first to say
That I was wrooooong
Oooh I know
im probably much too late
To try and apologize
for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he hold you hands
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
Cause I remember how much
You loved to dance

Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying

She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day



Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her she won't believe me

And it's so, it's so, sad to think that she don't see what I see

But every time she asks me do I look ok, I say



When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change

Cause you're amazing, just the way you are

And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while

Because girl you're amazing, just the way you are(yeah)



Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she let me

Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy

She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day



Oh, you know, you know, you know, I'd never ask you to change

If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same

So, don't even bother asking if you look ok

You know I'll say



When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change

Cause you're amazing, just the way you are

And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while

Because girl you're amazing, just the way you are

The way you are, the way you are

Girl you're amazing, just the way you are



When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change

Your eyes are where I’m lost in
Underneath the chandelier
We’re dancing all alone
There’s no reason to hide
What we feeling inside right now
So baby let’s just
turn down the lights
And close the door
Ooh I love that dress
but you won’t need it anymore
No you won’t need it no more
Let’s just kiss till we naked baby

Take it off for me for me for me

Take it off for me for me for me

I unzip the back and watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No don’t be afraid to show it all
I’ll be right here ready to hold you
Girl you know you perfect
from your head down to your heels
Don’t be confused by my smile
Cause I aint never been more

So just turn down the lights
And close the door

without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it
when I see you again
We've come a long way
from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it
when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn who knew
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing
right here talking to you
Bout another path
I know we loved to
hit the road and laugh
But something told me
that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things
different see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place
How could we not talk about family
when family's all that we got
Everything I went through
you were standing there by my side
And now you gone be
with me for the last ride
It's been a long day
without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it
when I see you again
We've come a long way
from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it
when I see you again
When I see you again
First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small
turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when i'm gone
How could we not talk about family
when family's all that we got
Everything I went through
you were standing there by my side
And now you gone be
with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way yea
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home
Hoooooome

without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it

We've come a long way

I’ll be looking back
Wishing it could last forever
Oh yesterday
Seem so far away
Long dress, No shoes
Summer nights
Golden and blue
It feels just like we’re stuck
I side a picture frame
These memories never fade away
Whisper to me
We got the world
Right at our feet
And I just wanna sit right
here and look at you
That’s probably all I ever do
Oh When i get old
I’ll be looking back
Wishing it could last forever
Oh yesterday
Seem so far away
Where did it go
All of the nights
All the time we spent together
Oh yesterday
Seem so far away
Wake up and smile
Cause you’re beautiful
Those hazel eyes
When I get old
that’s all I wanna think about
I probably
shouldn’t say this out loud
High hopes
Big dreams
And a little scared
Way too naive
Thinking you always be mine
and never leave my side
At least these memories
never say goodbye
Oh When i get old
I’ll be looking back
Wishing it could last forever
Oh yesterday
Seem so far away
Where did it go
All of the nights
All the time we spent together
Oh yesterday
Seem so far away
Someday im running out of time
I’ll see your picture in my mind
I’ll keep our love frozen in time

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead
Long live the king
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered
that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt
and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
never a honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows
and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe
what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king

You'll see me moving on
and hate that I'm gone
I can see it you're comin' back
Call me a telepath
Now's about the time
that boredom hits Oh-oh
Now you are at my door
Drunk and asking me for a kiss
When yesterday you said
that you hate my guts
Now you're back in love
It's just so you
you're just so predictable
Won't you try something original
Old news reused
that's why I don't cry
'Cause I got a feeling
You're comin' back
just like you have in the past
Yeah I got a feeling
You'll be sendin' me trash
you shoulda left in the drafts
Yeah I got a feeling
You'll see me moving on
and hate that I'm gone
I can see it you're comin' back
Call me a telepath
But I bet you I bet you
I bet you I bet you
I'll call you when I'm cuttin'
you off
I bet you I bet you
I bet you I bet you
Return at perfect timing
And I won't stop you from tryin'
'Cause I got a feeling
You're comin' back
just like you have in the past
Woah
Yeah I got a feeling
You'll be sendin' me trash
you shoulda left in the drafts
Yeah I got a feeling Inside
You'll see me moving on
and hate that I'm gone
I can see it you're comin' back
Oh-woah
Call me a telepath
La-la-la-la-la-la
Call me a telepath oh-woah

Sober sober sober
This party's shit wish we could dip
Go anywhere but here
Don't take a hit don't kiss my lips
And please don't drink more beer
I'ma crawl out the window now
'Cause I don't like anyone around
Kinda hope you're followin' me out
But this is definitely not my crowd
Nineteen but you
act twenty-five now
Knees weak but you
talk pretty fly wow
Ripped jeans and a cup
that you just downed
Take me where the music
ain't too loud
Trade drinks
but you don't even know her
Save me 'til the party is over
Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
Real sweet
but I wish you were sober
Wish you were so
wish you were so
wish you were sober
I wish you were sober
Wish you were so
wish you were so
wish you were sober
I wish you were sober
Trip down the road
walking you home
You kiss me at your door
Pulling me close
beg me stay over
But I'm over this roller coaster
I'ma crawl out the window now
Getting good at saying
Gotta bounce
Honestly you always
let me down
And I know
we're not just hanging out
Nineteen but you
act twenty-five now
Knees weak

Ripped jeans and a cup

Disaster,Conan Gray,Superache,2022.06.24,POP,"4,532","Let me just set the scene
I just left the party at Blake's
and it's Halloween
Had the keys to my car in my hand
but I didn't leave
'Cause the potential of us
it was keepin' me up all night long
I left a text you won't read
all night long
This could be a disaster
There's so many factors
like what if you freak out
And then we're losin' it all
at the critical chapter
Where I say I love you
and you don't say it after
This could be a disaster
Pedalling backwards
by sayin' that I'm drunk
I really shouldn't have called
I'm a little bit plastered
You call me a liar
now I'm fallin' in faster
This could be a disaster
Oh oh oh disaster
Oh oh oh disaster
Let me just lose my mind
Is it purely platonic to call me
like every night
You know Ashley believes that
there's something between you and I
But if I'm readin' it wrong man
it'd be better off if I die oh
And if you're readin' the text
all night long
This could be a disaster
There's so many factors
like what if you freak out
And then we're losin' it all
at the critical chapter

Maybe I just made it up messed it up"

the one to forget
I thought of everything
I'd never regret
A little time with you
is all that I get
That's all we need
because it's all we can take
One thing I never see
the same way around
I don't believe it
and it slips on the ground
I wanna take you to that
place in the Roche
But no one gives us
any time anymore
You used me once
if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it
then you ran off
I got this picture of us
kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing
that you said
I listened to your problems
now listen to mine
I didn't want to anymore
oh oh oh
And we will never be
alone again
Cause it doesn't happen
every day
Kinda counted on you
being a friend
Kinda given up on giving away
Now I thought about
what I wanna say
But I never really know
where to go
So I chained myself
to a friend
Cause there's nowhere else
I could go
And we will never be
alone again
Cause it doesn't happen
every day
Kinda counted on you
being a friend
Kinda given up on
giving away
Now I thought about
what I wanna say
But I never really know
where to go
So I chained myself
to a friend
Some more again
It didn't matter what
they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone
that looked just like me
The summer memory
that just never dies
We worked too long and
hard to give it no time
He sees right through me
it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that
I would try and disguise
He runs the scissor
at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down
or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars
hiding in the cold
Take it
oh I don't wanna sing
anymore
Listen to you brother
and listen to me
I didn't want to anymore
oh oh oh
And we will never be
alone again
Cause it doesn't happen
every day

But we can be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy-dummy
I likе to say, ""What if?"", but if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе on to somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last, on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip-gloss, hickeys too, huh

Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga
I can't even exhale, nigga
Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught creepin' with your friend
You ain't even half man lyin' on your—, you know that
Got me a bag for the break, you know that
Control don't slow the pace, if I pull back
All this ass for real (Ahh)
Drama make you feel (Ahh)

You tellin' these hoes you ain't trickin' off
But with me, you know I'm gon' get it all
How you niggas get so carried away?
Trippin' when that dick is barely third place
Fucked out of pity, it's cute that you lame
Dip 'cause it's mid, I can't fake like it's hangin'



Slimin' you out, I'm slimin' you out, I'm slimin' you out
Oh-woah, woah

Yeah
January, you pretend to see life clearly, yearly
February is the time that you put the evil eye
and the pride aside
For the fantasy of gettin' married, very scary
March got you already second guessin' titles
April, spring is here and just like a spring, you start to spiral
May brings some warmer days, poolside, gettin' very tan
June have you movin' ice cold,
goin' back and forth with a married man
July, that's when I found out you lied
August, it was ""baby"" this,
""baby"" that like you had your tubes tied
September, we fallin' off,
but I'm still the man you tryna win over
October is all about me
'cause your turn should've been over
November got you moodboardin' for next year
and you're single
December the gift-givin' month
and now you wanna rekindle our year
Tryna build trust, showin' me your DMs,
how they tryna bag you
Ironic how the news I got about you
ended up bein' bad news
Get a nigga hit for fifty racks, girl,
the beef cost like it's wagyu
Get a nigga hit,
I'll make his ass see the light like a half-moon
Shout to QC, pretty sure
I made Pee M's like it's past noon
All I really know is W's and M's,
life lookin' like a bathroom
All I really know is M bags like I drove through
and ordered fast food
Sayin' that I'm too guarded with my feelings,
who the fuck even asked you?
Seven bodyguards just in case
somebody really wanna try and crash through
Don't know why I listen to you
when I hear you talkin' to me, it's some half-truths
If I don't pay your rent,
it end up like an old hairstyle, girl, it's past due
If I don't—

First person shooter mode,
we turnin' your song to a funeral
To them niggas that say they want offices,
you better be talkin' my work in cubicles
Yeah, them boys had it locked, but I knew the code
Lot of niggas debatin' my numeral,
not the three, not the two, I'm the U-N-O
Yeah
Numero U-N-O
Me and Drizzy, this shit like the Super Bowl
Man, this shit damn near big as the-

Big as the what? Big as the what? Big as the what?
Big as the Super Bowl
But the difference is it's just two guys
playin' shit that they did in the studio
Niggas usually send they verses back to me
and they be terrible, just like a two-year old
I love a dinner with some fine women
When they start debatin' about who the G.O.A.T
I'm like ""Go 'head, say it then, who the G.O.A.T.?
""Who the G.O.A.T.? Who the G.O.A.T.?
Who the G.O.A.T.?""
""Who you bitches really rootin' for?""
Like a kid from January, then November,
nigga, it's just do it cold
Big as the what? Big as the what? Big as the what?
Big as the Super Bowl

Niggas so thirsty to put me in beef
Dissectin' my words and start lookin' too deep
I look at the tweets and start suckin' my teeth
I'm lettin' it rock 'cause I love the mystique
I still wanna get me a song with YB
Can't trust everything that you saw on IG
Just know if I diss you,
I made sure you know that
I hit you like I'm on your caller ID
I'm namin' the album ""The Fall Off"", it's pretty ironic,
'cause it ain't no fall off for me
Still in this bitch gettin' bigger,
they waitin' on the kid
to come jot like a father to be
Love when they argue the hardest MC, is it K-Dot,
is it Aubrey or me?
We the big three like we started a league,
but right now, I feel like Muhammed Ali
Huh, yeah, yeah, huh, yeah, Muhammed Ali
Yeah, the one that they call
when they shit ain't connectin' no more,
feel like I got a job in IT
Rhymin' with me is the biggest mistake
The Spider-Man meme is me lookin' at Drake
It's like we recruited your homies to beat demon
we got 'em a ten in the weight
Hate how the gang gotta wait for the bars, man,
this shit like a prison escape
Everybody steppers, well fuck it,
then everybody breakfast,
and I'm 'bout to clear up my plate (Huh huh, huh)
When I show up, it's motion picture blockbuster

The spot rusher, sprayed
his whole shit up, the crop duster
Not Russia, but block rusher

I'm 'bout to click, woah
I'm 'bout to click out on this shit
I'm 'bout to click, woah
I'm down to click out

I click the trigger on the stick like a high beam
Man, I was Bentley wheel whippin'

She call my number, leave her hangin',
she got dry-cleaned
She got a Android, her messages is lime green
I search one name,
and end up seein' twenty tings
Nadine, Christine, Justine, Kathleen,
Charlene, Pauline, Claudine
Man, I pack 'em in this phone
like some sardines
And they send me naked pictures,
it's the small things
You niggas still takin' pictures on a Gulfstream
My youngins richer than
you rappers and they all stream
I really hate that you been sellin' them
some false dreams
Man, if your pub was up for sale,
I buy the whole thing
Will they ever give me flowers?
Well, of course not
They don't wanna have that talk,
'cause it's a sore spot
They know The Boy,
the one they gotta boycott
I told Jimmy Jam
I use a GRAMMY as a door stop
Girl gave me some head because I need it
And if I fuck with you,
then after I might eat it, what?
Niggas talkin' 'bout
when this gon' be repeated

wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
you ain't getting over him

Find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up

Come along for the ride
Oh my outfit so tight
You can see my heart beat tonight
I can take the heat

That’s the moment I shine
Cuz every romance
Shakes and it bends
Don’t give a damn
When the nights here
I don’t do tears
Baby no chance
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place
Lately I’ve been
Moving close to the edge
Still be looking my best
I stay on the beat
You can count on me
I ain’t missing no steps
Cuz every romance
Shakes and it bends
Don’t give a damn

I don’t do tears

Darling just dive right in
and follow my lead
Well I found a girl
beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were
the someone waiting for me
Cause we were just kids
when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling just kiss me slow
your heart is all I own
And in your eyes
you’re holding mine
Baby I’m dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it
darling you look perfect tonight
Well I found a woman
stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams
I hope that someday
I’ll share her home
I found a love
to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love
to carry children of our own
We are still kids
but we’re so in love
fighting against all odds
I know we’ll be alright this time
Darling just hold my hand
be my girl
I’ll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby I’m dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress
looking so beautiful
I don’t deserve this
darling you look perfect tonight
Baby I’m dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met
an angel in person
And she looks perfect
no I don’t deserve this
You look perfect tonight"

still fall as hard at 23

fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand

you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of
a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart

That maybe we found love
right where we are
When my hair's overgone
and my memory fades
And the crowds
don't remember my name
When my hands don't play
the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same

never grow old it's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever
in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people
fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I just keep on making
the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of

Nothing happens after two
It’s true it’s true

Falling over everything to
reach the first times spark
Started under neon lights

Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks

different no one is ever ready

Everything changes, nothing’s the same
Except the truth is now you’re gone

from the windowsill
Threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album
Matthew had made
Memories of a life
that’s been loved
Took the get well soon cards
and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer
down the sink
Dad always told me
don’t you cry when you’re down
But mum there’s a tear
every time that I blink
Oh I’m in pieces
it’s tearing me up but I know
A heart that’s broke
is a heart that’s been loved
So I’ll sing Hallelujah
you were an angel
in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you’d be there
holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He’ll say Hallelujah you’re home
I fluffed the pillows
made the beds
stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns
neatly in a case
John said he’d drive then
put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side
of my face
I hope that I see the world
as you did cause I know
A life with love is a life
that’s been lived
So I’ll sing Hallelujah
you were an angel
in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you’d be there
holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
when God takes you back
He’ll say Hallelujah you’re home

you were an angel

You got to see the person
that I have become
Spread your wings and I know

he said Hallelujah you’re home"

I saw a shooting star

I sang a lullaby by the

If you were here I'd sing to you
You're on the other side
As the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from
America
I wonder do you see them too
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us
home
I can hear your heart on the
radio beat
They're playing Chasing Cars
and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying
next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand
Back through lamp lit streets
and knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over
Amsterdam
Hear the song my heart is
beating to
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me

Quitting I still might
Why do I put up this fight
Why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough
just dealing with real life
Sometimes I want to jump on stage
and just kill mics
And show these people
what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Something ain't right
Hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright
Drawing a blank like
Dah dah dah dah
It ain't my fault
Great then I fall
My insides crawl
And I clam up
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's
just been stripped
I have just been ripped
So I must then get
Off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit
Yo I'm going the fuck home
World on my shoulders
as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up
and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters
into my own hands

man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry momma I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps
I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape
from this 8 Mile Road
Walking these train tracks
Tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore
I go back to the same crap
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap
Gotta move ASAP
Get a new plan
Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV
buries her nose in her pad
And just colors
until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother
her mother and dad
Ain't no telling what really
goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy
that neither one of us had
But I keep running from something
I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
'cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like a grew up
but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't got a rep my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much
man I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin' you God
Please don't let me be pigeon
holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homie
wherever you are
Yo I'm telling you dog
I'm bailing this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there the only
way I know
And I'ma be back for you
the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own

You didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is
Why it was and it still is
To be walking this borderline
of Detroit's city limits
It's different and
it's a certain significance
A certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You'd never seen heard
smelled or met a real mc
Who's incredible or
on the same pedestal as me
But yet still unsigned
Having a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends
and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve
MC's in the lunch line
When it comes crunch time
Where did my punch lines go
Who must I show
To bust my flow
Where must I go
Who must I know
Or am I just another crab
in the bucket
Cause I ain't having to run
with this little rabbits but fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet
I'm starting to doubt shit
I'm feeling a little skeptical
who I hang out with
I live like a bum
yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army trying
to salvage an outfit
And it's cold
Trying to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always
stuck in this battling mode
My defenses are so up
The one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
This city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I just feel like
I'm being pulled apart
From each one of my limbs
By each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me
want to jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not
What I'm doing I just blow
my head is a stove top
I just explode
the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth
just overloads the ass
that I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to u turn
Yo it only takes one time
for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' on next time
I'll meet a new girl
I can not only play stupid
or be immature
I got every ingredient
all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat
all I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst
of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world
leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross
over the median curb
Hit the burbs and
all you see is a blur
I'm Eight Mile Road
I'm a man
Gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up
and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters
into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks
man I'ma never look back

suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince
turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me
I'm just obscene Yeah
Though I'm not the first
king of controversy
I am the worst thing
since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy Hey
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other
white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Lose Yourself,Eminem,8 Mile (Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture),2002.10.29,"랩/힙합, 국외영화","1,147","Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted-One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin, how everybody's jokin now
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that
Is he? No
He won't have it , he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo
This whole rap shit
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
[Hook:]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin, but superstardom's close to post mortar
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old potna, but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da
[Hook]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonor caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screamin on and
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got

at the ground and think

And he didn't believe me

Give me your heart

So come away starting today
Start a new life
together in a different place
We know that love is how all these
ideas came to be
So baby run away with me
Seventeen and we got
a dream to have a family
A house and everything in between
And then oh suddenly
we turned twenty-three
Now we got pressure
for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs
and got bills to pay
Have old friends
and now our enemies

Without Me (Feat. Juice WRLD),Halsey,Manic,2020.01.17,POP,920,"Ah-all I ever wanted

[Verse 1: Halsey]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey, Halsey & Juice WRLD]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus: Halsey]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Halsey]
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey, Halsey & Juice WRLD]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet

Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

[Verse 3: Juice WRLD]
I'm sad inside, but I know it's for the best, right?
You had to realize where you drew the line
I would cross the line a thousand times
You've got what I need, bae, I need your spotlight
Along the lines of social suicide, I refuse to die not by your side
So I'll take what I can from you, then I'll hide
And save the ""Lucid Dreams"" for another time
I still hate it when you're not there
I know I should, I know I should, but no, I don't care
I still hate it when you're not there
This life's not fair, took advantage of that

[Chorus: Halsey, Juice WRLD, & Both]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there? (Ah-ah)
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me (Life's not fair)
You know I'm the one who put you up there (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely? (Lonely)

Young M-I-S-S-I-O-N-A-R-Y

She stole my heart then she got archived
I keep it short wit a bitch
Lord Farquaad

All the girls in the front row
All the girls in the barricade
All the girls that been waiting all day
Let your tongue hang out
Fuck everything

If you came with a man
Let go of his hand
Errbody in a suite
Kickin up they feet
Stand up bitch dance

And all the guys in the back waitin on the next track
Cut ya boy a little slack

I’m Vanilla baby
I’ll choke you
But I ain’t no killa baby
She 28 tellin me I’m still a baby
I get love in Detroit like Skilla baby
And the thing about ya boy is

I don’t like no whips and chains and you can’t tie me down

It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep saying
our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
Fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you're my destiny
What if we rewrite the stars
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one
I was meant to find
It's up to you
and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight
You think it's easy
You think I don't want to
run to you
But there are mountains
And there are doors
that we can't walk through
I know you're wondering why
Because we're able to be
Just you and me
Within these walls
But when we go outside
You're going to wake up and
see that it was hopeless after all
No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one
you were meant to find
It's not up to you
It's not up to me
When everyone tells us
what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars
Say that the world can be ours
Tonight
All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
it's not impossible
Is it impossible
Say that it's possible
How do we rewrite the stars
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing can keep us apart
'Cause you are the one
I was meant to find
It's up to you
And it's up to me
No one can say
what we get to be
And why don't
we rewrite the stars
Changing the world to be ours
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break
and my hands are tied"

You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night way
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute
I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said I already told ya
I think that you should
get some rest
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
Cause I played it cool
when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I wake you up
with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my
lucky stars for that night
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute I forget
that I'm older
I wanna dance
with you right now oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday
you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Daring your love is more
than its worth in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghost
Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most
I'm gonna love you till
my lungs give out
I promise till death
we part Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now every body knows
Cause it's just you and me

Impossible,James Arthur,Impossible,2013.01.08,POP,"6,371","I remember years ago
Someone told me
I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did
And you were strong
And I was not
My illusion
My mistake
I was careless
I forgot
I did
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone
And so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible impossible
Impossible impossible
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on
love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know I know
And now when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with
embarrassing me
On your own
You can go ahead tell them
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the roof tops
Write it on the sky line
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken

You make it easier

I'm lucky I'm in love

Lucky to have been where

Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I wait for you
I promise you I will

I'm lucky we're in love every way
Lucky to have stayed

Lucky to be coming home someday

To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music
feel the air
I put a flower in your hair
And though the breeze is
through trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keep spinning round
You hold me right here right now

take a stab at it
If you like the way
I'm thinkin' baby wink at it
I may be skinny at times
but I'm fat fulla rhymes
Pass me the mic and I'm a grab at it
Well isn't it delicious
crazy way that I'm kissin'
'Cause baby listen to this
don't wanna miss it while it's hittin'
Sometimes you gotta fit in to get in
But don't ever quit cause soon
I'm gonna let you in but see
I don't care what she
might think about me
You can vibe without me if you want
I could be the one to take her home
Baby we could rock the night alone
If we never get down it
wouldn't be a let down
But sugar don't forget
what you already know
I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge me by the color
confuse it for another
You might regret what you
let slip away
Like the geek in the pink

Well this relationship fodder
don't mean to bother nobody
But Cupid's automatic musta
fired multiple shots at her
Because she fall in love too
often that's what the matter
At least I talk about it keep
a pattern of flattery and
She was starin' through the doorframe
Eyeing me down like already
a bad boyfriend
Well she can get her toys
outta the drawer then
Cause I ain't comin' home
I don't need that attention see
I don't care what she
might think about me
You can vibe without me if you want
I could be the one to take her home
Baby we could rock the night alone
If we never get down it

Don't judge it by the color

Hey baby look at me go
From zero to hero
You better take it from a
geek like me I can
save you from unoriginal dum dums
Who wouldn't care if you com
plete him or not
So what I've got a short
attention span A coke in my hand
Because I'd rather have the afternoon
relax and understand
My hip hop and flip flops it
don't stop with the light rock
A shot to mock you kinda
puts me in the tight spot
The hype is nothing more than
hoo ha so
I'm Developing a language and
I'm callin' it my own
So take a peek into the speaker
and you'll see what I mean
That on the other side the
grass is greener
I don't care what she
might think about me
You can vibe without me if you want
I could be the one to take her home
Baby we could rock the night alone
If we never get down it

wildfire,Jeremy Zucker,glisten,2018.05.04,POP,"2,555","Though I've been a mess since you met me
No, it's never felt this empty
Had the treelines shine in the night sky
Till it all burned down in a wildfire

Pre-Chorus
I had it all
You had my heart
We fell in love
And it fell apart

Chorus
And I know it's so one-sided
I'm sick of deciding
How it burns inside of me
Just let me breathe
Just let me breathe

Verse 2
We were both 18 when I told you
It'll all be fine when it's over
But your face lit up in the moonlight
When we both set fire to the skyline

Pre-Chorus
I had it all
You had my heart
We fell in love
And it fell apart

Chorus
And I know it's so one-sided
I'm sick of deciding
How it burns inside of me
Just let me breathe
Just let me breathe
Just let me breathe
Just let me breathe

Go celebrate and I'll be

You'd learn to close
each open door for me

Hang up if you ever think of calling
Me up not afraid to say it darling
Sorry I'm not sorry if it hurts
I don't mean to make it worse
I've decided that
I'm not your fucking friend
Right now there's not
much that we agree on
Sit down if you need
someone to lean on
Honest if I'm coming to your place
It's to say it to your face
I've decided that
I'm not your fucking friend
I think you might be okay
Could care less what your friends say
Well I'd rather sit in silence
Than be here while you're crying

Ignorance is bliss I hear and
I have always been sincere to you

My gossipy neighbor's for sure
I'm a genie tell me what your wish is

it don't want to see
my parents go
One generation's length away
From fighting life out on my own
Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't but honestly
won't someone stop this train
So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
to find away to say
that life has just begun
Had a talk with my old man
Said help me understand
He said turn 68 you'll renegotiate
Don't stop this train
Don't for a minute change
the place you're in
Don't think I couldn't ever
understand
I tried my hand
John honestly we'll
never stop this train
See once in a while
when it's good
It'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And you're still safe and sound
And you don't miss a thing
'til you cry when you're
driving away in the dark
Singing stop this train
I want to get off and go
home again
I can't take this speed
it's moving in
I know I can't
Cause now I see
I'll never stop this train"
Go Easy On Me,John Mayer,The Complete 2012 Performances Collection,2016.11.24,록/메탈,86,"Go easy on me for the night has been long
I'm not quite as strong as you see me
I came here alone and I'll leave on my own
The next stop is home so go easy on me

Oh, I don't need your truth
Or a good talking to from your mountain
No, I don't know your name and I won't take the blame
Don't know what you need, so go easy on me

Go easy on me, for I mean you no harm
It's possible charm is in order
But you make it so hard when you throw up your guard
I'm not here to spar so go easy on me

Oh, the clanging of swords
And the war of the words doesn't move me
See, my heart barely works and it's covered in dirt
It still kind of hurts, so go easy on me

Oh, I see in your eyes
You don't realize what you're doing
So, here's some advice, never hurts to be nice
If you're not gonna be, then go easy on me
Go easy on me, go easy on me"

To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise
She comes and goes and
comes and goes
Like no one can

Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to
techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything
She comes and goes and
comes and goes
Like no one can
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
Neon neon
Neon neon
Who knows how long
how long how long
She can go before she burns away

I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to
hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can
She comes and she goes
Like no one can
She comes and she goes

You don’t have to feel that no more

While chasing the clouds away

In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today

Ba de ya say do you remember
Ba de ya dancing in September
Ba de ya never was a cloudy day

And we say

Yes, she will sing to those who'll hear

강은 귀 기울여줄 이들을 위해 노래한단다

And in her song, all magic flows

그 노랫말에는 마법이 흐르지

But can you brave what you most fear?

네 가장 큰 두려움에 맞설 수 있겠니?

Can you face what the river knows?

강의 진실을 마주할 수 있겠니?

Beach town rests on the “drying” line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his 88 Ford?
Labrador hanging out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowing in my eyes
Blame it on the beach grown men don’t cry

Do you remember that beatdown basement couch
I’d sing you my love songs and you’d tell me about
How your momma ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything

A cold shoulder a closing time
you were begging me to stay till the sun rose
Strange words come on out of a grown man’s mouth when his minds broke
Pictures and passing time you only smile like that when you’re drinking
I wish I didn’t but I do, remember every moment on the nights with you

You’re drinking everything to ease your mind
When in the hell are you gonna ease mine
You’re like concrete feet in the summer heat
It burns like hell when two souls meet
And you’ll never be the man you always swore
But I’ll remember your singing in that ’88 Ford

A cold shoulder a closing time
you were begging me to stay till the sun rose
Strange words come on out of a grown man’s mouth when his minds broke
Pictures and passing time you only smile like that when you’re drinking

The struggle of stayin'

Well the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out
in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well darlin' I'm just
tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
hangin' over your head
If you could see what I see
You'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow red and orange and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the bow
take off your coat
and take a look around
'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out
in the same ol' storm again

Oh tie up the bow take off your coat

I call her Karma
She'll eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful
Try not to leader her on
Shorty heart is on steroids
Cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love
when you meet her
If you get the chance
you better keep her
She's sweet as pie
but if you break her heart
She'll turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending
with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon'put her in a coma
Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad
sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted
So you wanna play with magic
Boy you should know
what you're falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
Cause I'm coming
atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for ready for
A perfect storm perfect storm
Cause once you're mine
once you're mine
There's no going back"

I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbeque
There's a hickie or a bruise
Pictures of last night
Eended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a black top blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois
Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop op
Whoa oh oah
This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
With my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail
Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled

My Benjamin Franklins

My paper planes makin a dance
Get dirty all night
that's part of my thing
Keep building castles
that's made out of sand
She's amazing the fire blazing
Hotter than cajun
Girl won't you move a lil closer
Time to get paid
it's maximum wage
That body belong on a poster
I'm in a daze
that bottom is wavin' at me
Like damn it I know you
You wanna show like a gun
out of holster
Tell me whatever and
I'll be your roper
You spin my head right round

Ain't nothin more
beautiful to be found
It's goin down down
I'm spendin my money
I'm out of control
Somebody help me
She's takin my bank roll
But I'm king of the club
And I'm wearin the crown
Poppin these bottles
Touchin these models
Watchin they asses go down down

You spin my head right round

When you go down

You spin my head right round

When you go down

You spin my head right round

A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all
'Cause you are near
and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree
You're here
where you should be

as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing
if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
And then one day
everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree
You're here
where you should be

Alone on Christmas day
Presents what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing

You're all that I need
Underneath the tree tonight

the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
cause my heart so much misery
I will not break
the way you did
You fell so hard
I learned the hard way
to never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray
too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play
on the safe side
So I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me
but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long
before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know
that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
a smile a laugh
Every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole
to start with
Because of you
I never stray
too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play
on the safe side
So I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me

Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die
I heard you cry
Every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known
better than to lean on me
You never thought
of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry
In the middle of the night
Over the same damn thing

I never stray
too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play
on the safe side

My Grown Up Christmas List,Kelly Clarkson,R&B Christmas Hits,2009.10.27,POP,511,"Do you remember me

I sat upon your knee

I wrote to you

With childhood fantasies



Well, I'm all grown up now

And still need help somehow

I'm not a child

But my heart still can dream



So here's my lifelong wish

My grown up christmas list

Not for myself

But for a world in need



No more lives torn apart

That wars would never start

And time would heal all hearts

And everyone would have a friend

And right would always win

And love would never end

This is my grown up christmas list



As children we believed

The grandest sight to see

Was something lovely

Wrapped beneath our tree



But heaven only knows

That packages and bows

Can never heal

A hurting human soul



No more lives torn apart

That wars would never start

And time would heal all hearts

And everyone would have a friend

And right would always win

And love would never end

This is my grown up christmas list



What is this illusion called the innocence of youth

Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth

(there'd be)



No more lives torn apart

That wars would never start

And time would heal all hearts

And everyone would have a friend

And right would always win

And love would never end, oh

This is my grown up christmas list



This is my grown up christmas list"

Spent the evening pretending it wasn’t that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment

You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess
That just keeps us depressed
We forget that we’re here right now

‘Coz we’re living life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race keep the pressure on
You’re bound to break
Something’s got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans
And not give a damn
If we’re missing out on what the people think is right

Seeing through a picture behind the screen
And forget to be, lose the conversation for the message that you’ll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh we should head out to the place where the music plays

And then we’ll go all night

Two stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I’m in your eyes
Electrified, we’ll keep turning up and go all night
Oh we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone and then loved
And all we need is us to go
All night, night
Two stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah, all we need is us

Baby
Sun coming up when we walk out
We lost the track of time
Everything that I been dealing with ain’t even cross my mind I don’t see nobody in here but us for real
For you I’m blind
We go anywhere
It don’t take much for us to catch a vibe
Come here I need to tell you something
Let me whisper in your ear
Do whatever to get you there I’ll put you on a Lear
Private island for a month straight
They’ll think you disappeared
Lamb truck look good on ya
I’m copping you that urus
I think I’m bout ready to make love in this club
Only thing I need is my drank and my drugs
I done got on 10 and forgot where I was
Some parts I don’t like but this part I love
Only me and my guys
I been having me a good time
You can see it in all in my eyes
Two stepping with shorty
Got her rocking side to side
You should let me know when you get ready to ride cause

We’ll go all night

Two stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I’m in your eyes
Electrified, we’ll keep turning up and go all night
Oh we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone then loved
And all we need is us to go
All night, night

my goddamn way
What is there to say
There ain't a better time
than today
But maybe I'll lay down
for a little yeah
Instead of always trying
to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know
what I'm saying it about

No they don't like it

But when I'm flying oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different
what's the difference
Well it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm running out of gas
hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work

something beautiful

Sometimes the truth
don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound

it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon
haven't seen the sun
in a while
But I heard
that the sky's still blue yeah
I heard they don't talk about me
too much no more

with a closed door

into hand me downs
Down down down down down
Down down down down down

my conscience ain't doin' bad
Because I try to minus the
problems that I attract
And half the time the wheels
that's in the back of my mind
Just keep on turning 'til the
tires flat and burn
until the fire crack
I do not lie though
facts may seem a little farfetched
That's only 'cause I may be make
believe and full of darkness
When I'm stuck
between a rock and a hard place
Walk and drop in change
inside your empty guitar case
That's charity um
I move carelessly that's why
I'm always tripping
I guess that's like electrolytes
you help me go the distance
Not too efficient but the way
it's always been
Until the day we have
to meet again
Get away when it ain't really
safe and it don't seem right

I can′t see a thing and yet i feel you walking my way

Empty stage with nothing but this girl
Who′s singing this simple melody
And wearing her heart on her sleeve

And right now I have you
For a moment i can tell i′ve got you
Cause your lips don′t move
And something is happening
Cause your eyes tell me the truth
I′ve put a spell over you

Beauty emanates from every word that you say
You've captured the deepest thoughts in the purest and simplest of ways
But you see
I′m not that graceful like you Nor am i as eloquent
But just a simple melody can change the way that you see me

And right now I have you
For a moment i can tell i′ve got you
Cause your lips don′t move
And something is happening
Cause your eyes tell me the truth
I′ve put a spell over you

And all my life i′ve stumbled But up here i am just perfect

The people we
used to be
It's even harder
to picture
That you're not
here next to me
You say it's too
late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in our time
that you wasted
All of our bridges
burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out
the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that

sets in paradise

'round wondering
Why it wasn't
you who came up
from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me
I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start
with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since
I blew up or whatever
you call it
Switched the number
to my phone
so you never could call it
Don't need my name
on my shirt
you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish what a shame
coulda got picked
Had a really good
game but you missed
your last shot
So you talk about
who you see at
the top
Or what you
could've saw
But sad to say it's
over for
Phantom pulled up valet
open doors
Wished I'd go away
got what you was
looking for

they want

that little piece of shit

Steal some covers
share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us
in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold

But things just get so crazy
living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road
get up and go if I knew
That someday it would
lead me back to you
That someday it would
lead me back to you
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like
branches in a storm
Change the weather still together
when it ends
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Singing sunday it'll bring me

look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten
Glistening once again
With candy canes
and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to
look a lot like Christmas (Christmas)
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of hop along boots
and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk
and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly
wait for school to start again
It's beginning to
look a lot like Christmas (Christmas)
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
The one in the park as well
The sturdy kind
that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to
look a lot like Christmas (Christmas)
Soon, all the bells will start
And the thing that
will make 'em ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Billie Jean,Michael Jackson,Billy Jean (Digital 45),2009.07.13,POP,"25,394","She was more like a beauty queen
from a movie scene
I said don't mind
but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor
in the round
She said I am the one who will dance
on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes
that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor
in the round
People always told me
be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking
young girls' hearts
And mother always told me
be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do
'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims
that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand
when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced
on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
just remember to always think twice
Do think twice
She told my baby that's a threat
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
Eyes would like mine
Go on dance on the floor
in the round baby
People always told me
be careful of what you do
And don't go around
breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover

I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers
in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
something whispers
in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone
Whisper three words
and I'll come running die
And girl you know that
I'll be there
I'll be there
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart

Dangerous,Michael Jackson,Dangerous,1991.11.26,POP,"7,220","The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl
The way she moved
Her hair her face her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
I never knew but I was
Walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
and don't you pretend we didn't
Talk on the phone
My baby cried
she left me standing alone
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped
into her Web of sin
A touch a kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return
Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
I never knew But I was
living in vain
She called my house
You said you know my name
And don't you pretend
You never did me before
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
'Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine
I cannot sleep alone tonight
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby
And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two edged sword
But I loved it
'Cause it's dangerous
Dasngerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time

And ones that got away

Turns out crowded rooms empty out as soon
There's somewhere else to go, oh-oh

with that blonde girl

She's so much older than me
She's everything

I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could
I ever love someone else

for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay
now that I'm gone

what you wrote
in that song about me
'Cause you said forever
now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know
you the way that I do yeah

Wait, is this the song with the drums?
I met a guy in the summer
and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wanderin' eye
He said he's six foot two and I'm like, ""Dude, nice try""
But he was so much fun
and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties
and the night would never end
Another song, another club,
another bar, another dance
And when he said, ""Something wrong?""
he'd just fly me to France
So I miss him some nights
when I'm feelin' depressed
'Til I remember every time
he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him?
I guess it's up and down
If I had to chose I would say it right now
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous,
wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him
and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge
And I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back
So I write him all these letters
and I throw them in the trash
'Cause I miss the way he kisses
and the way he made me laugh
Yeah, I pour my little heart out
but as I'm hittin' ""Send""
I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends
Because everyone knew
all of the shit that he'd do
He said I was the only girl
but that just wasn't the truth
And when I told him how he hurt me,
he'd tell me I was trippin'
But I am my father's daughter,
so maybe I could fix him
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous,
wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him
and it makes me real sad

I wanna make him lunch

I wanna break his heart

Then be the one to stitch it up
(And then I, I want to get him back)
Wanna kiss his face (I want to get him back)

afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out

Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember
We left a life
That's ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something
beautiful and loud
Like I'm picturing now
Castles glitter under
Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out
for you tonight
Snow white mountains
in a foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
I see a Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it

Got me ten feet off the ground.
And I'm hearin' what you say,
But I just can't make a sound.
You tell me that you need me,
Then you go and cut me down...
But wait...
You tell me that you're sorry,
Didn't think I'd turn around...
And say...

[Chorus]
That it's too late to apologize.
It's too late...
I said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
I'd take another chance,
Take a fall, take a shot for you.
I need you like a heart needs a beat,
But it's nothin' new.
I loved you with a fire red,
Now it's turnin' blue...
And you say...
Sorry, like an angel
Heaven let me think was you...
But I'm afraid...

[Chorus]
It's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
I said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
Whoa!

Too Much Love Will Kill You,Queen,Made In Heaven,2011.01.01,록/메탈,"13,871","I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone
For much too long I feel like no one
Ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle
It would be In my tangled
State of mind I've been looking back
To find where I went wrong
Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover and
The love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster
'Cos you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time

I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way
Out of this for me I used to bring you
Sunshine now all I ever do is
Bring you down How would it be
If you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible
To choose no there's no
Making sense of it every way
I go I'm bound to lose
Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as not at all
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time

Too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
In your life you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end In the end"

Love The Way You Lie (Part II) (Pt. 2) (Feat. Eminem),Rihanna,Loud,2010.01.01,POP,"62,832","On the first page of our story
the future seems so bright
And this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why
I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked
schemes and you take death
to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
even though you lost your mind
Just gonna stand there
and watch me burn
But that's alright because
I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there
and hear me cry
But that's alright because
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ooh I love the way you lie
Now this gravel in our voices
glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war
you'll always win
even when I'm right
Cause you feed me fables
from your hand
With violet words and empty
threats and it's sick that
all these battles are
what keeps me satisfied
Just gonna stand there
and watch me burn
But that's alright because
I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there
and hear me cry
But that's alright because
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh I love the way you lie
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run
but I don't wanna ever leave
Til the walls are goin' up
in smoke with all our memories
This morning you wake
a sunray hits your face
smeared makeup as we lay
in the wake of destruction
hush baby speak softly
tell me I'll be sorry that you
pushed me into the coffee
table last night
so I can push you off me
try and touch me
so I can scream at you
not to touch me
run out the room
and I'll follow you like
a lost puppy
baby without you
I'm nothing I'm so lost hug me
then tell me how ugly I am
but that you'll always love me
then after that shove me
in the aftermath of the
destructive path that we're on
two psychopaths but we
know that no matter how many
knives we put
in each other's backs
that we'll have each other's backs
'cause we're that lucky
together we move mountains
let's not make mountains
out of molehills
you hit me twice yeah
but who's countin'
I may have hit you three times
I'm startin' to lose count
but together we'll live forever
we found the youth fountain
our love is crazy we're nuts
but I refused counselin'
this house is too huge
if you move out
I'll burn all two thousand
square feet of it to the ground
ain't shit you can do about it
with you I'm in my fukin' mind
without you I'm out it
Just gonna stand there
and watch me burn
But that's alright because
I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there
and hear me cry
But that's alright because
I love the way you lie

Haven’t heard back yet

And it hurts me inside

Like, ""Where you at tonight?"" Got no alibi

She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

Driving in a circle, a whirlpool, going 'round forever
How could I be so lucky? Nobody has loved me without all the pressure
Of making tiny errors
'Cause we just laugh it off, still having a ball
I don't wanna go home 'til the rest of my life
You know nothing compares to the shattering feeling I get

But I know that

But when you call me baby

So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
Is that the way it is?

Words can't bring you down
You are beautiful in every single way

Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go

The sun will always shine

And tomorrow we might wake on the other side

She makes a man wants
to speak Spanish
Como se llama bonita
Oh baby when you

You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs
of my body
And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to
feel it's right
All the attraction the tension
Don't you see baby
this is perfection
Hey Girl
I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have
the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing
And when you walk up
on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore
the way you move
your body girl
And everything
so unexpected
the way you right and left it
So you can keep on taking it

Half animal half man
I don't
don't really know
what I'm doing
But you seem to
have a plan
My will and self restraint
Have come to
fail now fail now
See I am doing what I can
but I can't so you know
That's a bit too
hard to explain
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de dia

Senorita feel the conga

Mira en Barranquilla

Mira en Barranquilla

She's so sexy
every man's fantasy
a refugee like me back
with the Fugees
from a 3rd world country
I go back like when
'pac carried crates
for Humpty
I need a whole club dizzy
Why the C I A wanna watch us
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty
it's a musical transaction
Boo boop so boop
No more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas
'cause we own our own boats

And I'm starting to

SOS she is in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out coming out coming out
A domesticated girl that's
all you ask of me
Darling it is no joke
this is lycanthropy
Moon's awake now with eyes wide open
My body is craving so feed the hungry
I've devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday
And Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
or decent incentives to keep me at it
starting to feel just a litt abused
Like a coffine machine in an office
aaa
So I'm gonna go somewhere closer
To get me a lover and
tell you about it
There's a she wolf in the closet
Open u and set her free
howls
There's a she wolf in the closet
Let it out so it can breath

Sitting across the bar
staring right at her pray
It's going well so far
she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher
and I'm her student
To look at the single man
I've got on me a special radar
And the fire department's hotline
in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute
little divos or rich city guys
that just want to enjoy
I'm having a very good time
in the heat
very bad in the arms of a boy
There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set her free
howls

I'm terrified
You'll turn around
and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go
I've never been so sure in my life
I want to be with you
I want to fly with you
I want to be with you

I close my eyes
and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
on a balcony in summer air
See the lights
see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way
through the crowd
And say hello little did I know
That you were Romeo
you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said
stay away from Juliet
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you please don't go
And I said
Romeo take me somewhere
we can be alone
I'll be waiting
all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess
It's a love story Baby just say yes
So I sneak out to the
garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead
if they knew So close your eyes
Escape this town
for a little while
Cause you were Romeo
I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said
stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you please don't go
And I said
Romeo take me somewhere
we can be alone
I'll be waiting
all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess
It's a love story Baby just say yes
Romeo save me they're
trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult
but it's real Don't be afraid
we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story Baby just say yes
I got tired of waiting Wondering
if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you in the outskirts
of town And I said
Romeo save me
I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you
but you never come
Is this in my head
I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground
and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet
you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all
I really know I talked to your dad
go pick out a white dress

Ain't it funny rumors fly

Anti-Hero,Taylor Swift,Midnights (3am Edition),2022.10.21,POP,"15,019","I have this thing where I get older
But just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
At teatime everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun
But never in the mirror
It must be exhausting
Always rooting for the anti hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
(I'm the problem it's me)
At teatime everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun
But never in the mirror
It must be exhausting
Always rooting for the anti hero
I have this dream my daughter in law kills me
For the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers around and reads it
And then someone screams out
'She's laughing up at us from hell'
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
It's me hi
Everybody agrees everybody agrees
It's me hi (Hi)
I'm the problem it's me (I'm the problem it's me)
At teatime (Teatime)
Everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)

Always rooting for the anti hero"

I love you I meant it

I know you'd fool me again

cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in

Can't stop thinking about you and I

that I called you mine
Broke kids running
through the city
Drunk on the subway train
Set free every time you kissed me
We couldn’t feel no pain
You looked at me
and I looked at you
Like we’d never look away
Broke kids running
through the city
Don’t let the memory fade
You said hey whatcha doing
for the rest of your life
And I said I don’t even know
what I’m doing tonight
Went from one conversation
to your lips on mine
And you said I never regretted
the day
that I called you mine
So I call you mine
Can I call you mine
And you said I never regretted
the day
that I called you mine
Think about what
you believe in now
Am I someone
you cannot live without
Cause I know I don’t wanna
live without you
Yeah
Come on let’s turn this
all around
Bring it all back
to that bar downtown
When you wouldn’t
let me walk out on you
You said hey whatcha doing
for the rest of your life
And I said I don’t even know
what I’m doing tonight
Went from one conversation
to your lips on mine
And you said I never regretted

So I call you mine
And you said I never regretted

Can I call you mine

I'ma keep on singin'
while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it,
they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck,
makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe,
make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city,
I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch,
had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day,
tryna lose weight

You said Light my cigarette
So I lied to my mom and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked
your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss
Long nights daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings
I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes
always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to sixty I've been a fool
Strawberries and cigarettes
always taste like
Blue eyes black jeans
Lighters and candy I've been a fool
Strawberries and cigarettes
always taste like you
Remember when you taught me fate
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day nothing on my phone
But I can still smell you
on my clothes
Always hoping
that things would change
But we went right
back to your games
Long nights daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings
I've been a fool
Strawberries and cigarettes
always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to sixty I've been a fool
Strawberries and cigarettes
always taste like
Blue eyes black jeans
Lighters and candy I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes
always taste like you
And even if I run away
Give my heart a holiday
Still strawberries and cigarettes
always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for
Strawberries and cigarettes
always taste like you
Yeah they always taste like you
You
Long nights daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like you
Headlights on me
And even if I run away
Racing to sixty
I've been a fool
Still strawberries and cigarettes
always taste like
Blue eyes black jeans
You always leave me wanting more

We make a really good team
And though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry
Between us
Jump starting your car cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new cliches on our own little tour
Let's ride
You don't have to say I love you
to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars
and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out
of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey
don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you you
We try staying up late
But we both are light weights
Yeah we get off our face too easy
And we take jokes way too far
And sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart
We are we are we are
You don't have to say I love you
to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars
and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out

Sickeningly sweet like honey

All I need is you
All I need is you you
Eat a pill stay and chill
you don't need to go
I'm about to bring emo
back if you leave my home
I'd panic at the disco
and you'd rather watch a TV show
Then I'll squeeze your booty real hard
like I'm kneading dough
Pizza boy I'm speeding for ya
We can get married tonight if you really wanna
Me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer
And if you break this lil' heart
it'd be an honor
You don't have to say I love you
to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars

Like kids on concrete
Trying to sedate

And numb what I see
Awake wide eyed
I'm screaming at me
Trying to keep faith

Staring up at me

Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken oh

Maybe I don't want heaven

Careless Whisper,WHAM!,The Final,1986.07.28,POP,"3,693","I feel so unsure as I take your hand
당신 손을 잡고서 무대로 이끌지만
And lead you to the dance floor
난 확신이 서지 않아요

As the music dies
음악이 끝나고
Something in your eyes
뭔가가 있는 듯한 당신 눈을 보니
calls to mind the silver screen
영화의 장면이 떠올라요
And all its sad good-byes
슬픈 이별의 장면들이요

I`m never gonna dance again
다시는 춤추지 않을거에요
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
죄책감에 내 다리는 박자도 맞추지 못해요
Though it`s easy to pretend
아닌 척 하기는 쉽지만
I know you`re not a fool
당신이 바보가 아니란 것도 알아요

Should`ve known better than to cheat a friend
and waste the chance that I`ve been given
친구를 속이지 말았어야했는데
(↑친구를 속인게 아니라 애인을 두고 다른 여자친구와 바람을 피웠다는것입니다~)
내게 주어진 그댈 사랑할 기회를
날려버리지 말았어야 했는데
So I`m never gonna dance again
그래서 당신과 이런 춤은
The way I danced with you
다시 추지 않겠어요

Time can never mend
아무리 시간이 지나도 경솔했던
the careless whispers of a good friend
친구의 속삭임을 돌이킬 순 없어요
To the heart and mind ignorance is kind
모르는게 심신이 편했은 거에요
There`s no comfort in the truth
진실을 알아 봤자 편하지 않고
Pain is the all you`ll find
오직 고통만 있을 뿐이죠

I`m never gonna dance again
다시는 춤추지 않겠어요
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
죄책감에 내 다리는 박자도 맞추지 못해요
Though it`s easy to pretend
아닌 척 하기는 쉽지만
I know you`re not a fool

날려버리지 말았어야 했는데
So I`m never gonna dance again
그래서 당신과 이런 춤은
The way I danced with you
다시 추지 않겠어요
Never without your love
당신의 사랑 없이는 절대

Tonight the music seems so loud
오늘밤은 음악이 무척 요란하군요
I wish that we could lose this crowd
이 사람들로부터 떨어지고 싶어요
Maybe it`s better this way
어쩌면 이대로가 더 좋을지도 모르죠
We`d hurt each other
우리가 하고자 하는 말로
with the things we`d want to say
서로에게 상처를 줄지도 몰라요

We could have been so good together
우리 함께 잘 지낼 수도 있었어요
We could have lived this dance forever
영원토록 이 춤을 출 수도 있었어요
But no one`s gonna dance with me
하지만 아무도 나와 춤을 추려 않을 거에요
Please stay
제발 머물러줘요

And I`m never gonna dance again
다시는 춤추지 않겠어요
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
죄책감에 내 다리는 박자도 맞추지 못해요
Though it`s easy to pretend
아닌 척 하기는 쉽지만

Now that you`re gone
이제 당신이 떠났군요
Now that you`re gone
이제 당신이 떠나 버렸군요
What I did`s so wrong
날 혼자 두고 떠날 정도로
that you had to leave me alone
내가 뭘 잘못 했나요"

Where Did Your Heart Go?,WHAM!,한국인이 가장 사랑하는 팝 음악 40 Vol.6,2012.02.10,POP,356,"I spend my nights down on the wharf
In unlit alley ways
By the church downtown
Where Sally prays
Come down sometime
We’ll share a rusty can of corn
yeah
And listen to the radio
I love you
I love you it says
Where did your heart go
Did you put it on a train
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico
Where did your heart go
Did you put it on a train
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico
You cried but I don’t know
I’ve heard it all before
There it goes again
the slamming of the door
Sometimes the river calls me
And at night it calls my name
Says put your troubles down beside me
Things have always been the same
And rock ’n’ roll won’t teach me
What the river said that night
I jumped into this beauty
And drifted out of sight
Where did your heart go
Did you put it on a train
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico
Where did your heart go
Did you put it on a train
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico"

being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I've saving all my love for you
It's not very easy
living all alone
My friends try and tell me
find a man of my own
But each time I try
I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home
feeling blue
So I've saving all my love for you
You used to tell me we'd
run away together
Love gives you the right
to be free
You said be patient just
wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy
I've got to get ready
just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when
you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for
I feeling all right
We'll be making love
the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you
No other woman is gonna
love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that
I feeling all right
We'll be making love the
whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah I'm saving all my lovin'
Yes I'm saving all my
love for you for you"
One Moment In Time,Whitney Houston,Whitney The Greatest Hits,2000.05.23,R&B/Soul,"2,389","Each day I live
I want to be a day to give
The best of me
I'm only one but not alone
My finest day Is yet unknown
I broke my heart
Fought every gain
To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains
I want one moment in time
When I'm more than
I thought I could be
When all of my dreams
are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity
I've lived to be
The very best
I want it all
No time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance
Here in my hands
Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than
I thought I could be
When all of my dreams
are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity
You're a winner for a lifetime
If you seize that
one moment in time
Make it shine
Give me one moment in time
When I'm more than
I thought I could be
When all of my dreams
are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will be
I will be
I will be free
I will be
I will be free"
I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me),Whitney Houston,Whitney,1987.06.02,R&B/Soul,"2,789","Clock strickes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time
to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright
up till now
It's the light of day
that shows me how
And when the night falls
Loneliness calls
Oh I wanna dance
with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance
with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh I wanna dance
with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance
with somebody
With somebody who loves me
I've been in love
and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later
the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll
take a chance
On a love that burns
hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh I wanna dance
with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance
with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh I wanna dance
with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah I wanna dance
with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Somebody who loves me
To hold me in his arms
I need a man who'll
take a chance
On a love that burns
hot Enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh I wanna dance
with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance
with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh I wanna dance
with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
with somebody
Yeah I wanna dance
with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Ooh ooh dance
Come on baby dance
Ooh yeah dance
Let me get to this woh
Don't you wanna dance
with me baby
don't you wanna dance
with me boy
Don't you wanna dance
with me baby
With somebody who loves me
Don't you wanna dance
Say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance
Say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance
Say you wanna dance
With somebody who loves me"
When You Believe,"Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey",The Ultimate Collection,2007.10.29,R&B/Soul,"2,470","Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know
there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could
There can be miracles
when you believe
Though hope is frail
it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
you can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles
when you believe
Though hope is frail
it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
you can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe
They don't always happen
when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear
through the rain
A small but still resilient voice
says Help is very near
There can be miracles
when you believe
Though hope is frail
it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
you can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
Now you will
you will when you believe
You will when you believe
just believe
Just believe
you will when you believe"
I Have Nothing (Whitney Houston),소향,'나는 가수다 2' 7월 B조 경연,2012.07.08,발라드,"7,918","Share my life
Take me for what I am
Cause I'll never change all my
colors for you
Take my love
I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are
And everything that you do
I don't really need to look very
much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again this
passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms If you dare
Must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you
You see through right to the
heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love
I don't really need to look very
much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again this
passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide
Your love I remember forever
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms If you dare
Must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms If you dare
Must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
Don't walk away from me
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you"
